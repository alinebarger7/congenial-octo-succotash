## Welcome to my site

Hi, my name is Alexander Linebarger, but you can call me Alec. This is a very rough draft of my final GitHub page, so please take it easy. You can access, if you like, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-linebarger-67946a116/) and my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/alinebarger7/) if you want to know more about me.


#### Here's a picture of me:
