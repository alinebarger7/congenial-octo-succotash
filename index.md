## Welcome to my site

Hi, my name is Alexander Linebarger, but you can call me Alec. This is a very rough draft of my final GitHub page, so please take it easy. You can access, if you like, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-linebarger-67946a116/) and my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/alinebarger7/) if you want to know more about me.


#### Here's a picture of me:

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Creations

I have created several projects; the most notable of which are listed below.

- [Bus Tracker](https://github.com/alinebarger7/bustracker)
- [Pacmen](https://github.com/alinebarger7/pacman)
- [Eyetracker](https://github.com/alinebarger7/eyetracker)
- [The Rest](https://github.com/alinebarger7?tab=repositories)

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alinebarger7/congenial-octo-succotash/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
